1.Run Prep.R first. It contains the data management and data cleaning. Generate myplot1-myplot32.corr_test.R and sep_mod.R are functions used in all_mod.R.  core_test.R focuses on testing the correlation between each pair.  sep_mod.R works on logistic regression for each separate predictor.3.Run all_mod.R. It contains the logistic regression for all predictors and carries on selection process.Also generate diagnostic plots.
